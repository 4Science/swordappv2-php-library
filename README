Welcome to the SWORD v2 PHP client library!
-------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1

The SWORDAPP v2 PHP client library is a PHP library designed to assist with
the creation of SWORD deposit tools. The client library allows PHP code to
easily make use of the two SWORD functions:

 - GETting a Service Document
 - POSTing a file into a repository

The library was originally written by Stuart Lewis (stuart@stuartlewis.com) as
part of the JISC funded SWORD2 project. Limited support for the library is
availble via the sword-app-tech email list:

 - https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sword-app-tech

The library is licenced with the New BSD Licence. See the file LICENCE in the

How to use the library
----------------------
The easiest way to understand the library is to look at the 
test/test-swordappclient.php file which exercises all the functions and
variables of the library.

The main methods of use are from swordappclient.php:

 - function servicedocument(url, username, password, on-behalf-of-user)
 - function deposit(url, username, password, on-behalf-of-user, filename,
                   [format_namespace, package_type, noop, verbose]) 

The functions return a SWORDAPPServiceDocument, a SWORDAPPEntry or a 
SWORDAPPErrorDocument object as appropriate. These classes can then be 
interogated (e.g. $servicedocument->sac_workspaces).


Examples

Example SWORD applications are included in the examples directory:
